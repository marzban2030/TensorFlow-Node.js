# TensorFlow-Node.js
Simple high performance TensorFlow digits recognition code with Node.js (C++ &amp; V8 engine)

After coding TensorFlow in Python3 with TensorFlow module,
And after coding in Python2 with V8 engine and TensorFlow.js module,
And after coding in C++ with V8 engine and TensorFlow.js module,
The result was "C++ with V8 engine and TensorFlow.js" has most speed and less hardware resources usage.

Node.js is C++ with V8 engine: The V8 interface between C++ and JavaScript is used by the native code bindings that come with Node.
Coding in Node.js is better than coding in C++ with V8 engine.

Currently I am deciding to coding simple high performance TensorFlow digits recognition with Node.js here.
